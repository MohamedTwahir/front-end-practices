In this project i will be building a transparent sidebar.
In website layout, there is usually a strong chance you include a column of important links or information to the right or left of the main content area. This element in a webpage is famously known as a "sidebar".
It is a dominant across the web. This is why i saw it vital to understand how this feature works.

I understand not all websites need sidebars and some design features are much better of without them but i just found it interesting to go deeper with a purpose of understanding this feature

# What and why ?
This is one of the few questions i had on my mind before beginning this task.
From a quick google check i could find a sidebar is a column placed to the right or left of a webpage's primary content area. They are commonly used in displaying various types of supplementary information for users.
Most common information displayed are:
    * Navigational links to key pages.
    * Ads for products or services
    * Email signup forms
    * Popular or related posts
    * Social media links


The primary advantaged of incorporating sidebar to your website is visibility. Users are able to navigate throughtout your site. This enables one to make key information and features readily available at all times.
Sidebars are often containing (Call to Action(CTA)) elements such as email subscription forms and ads. Navigational features are also dominant in them.


#Types of websites which heavily rely on sidebars;
    * Content-Heavy websites(blogs, newsites and online magazines)
    * online stores
        - related products and past purchases
        - Add to cart buttons
        - Buyer review and ratings
        - shopping cart view

# For this task i used a sidebar for content heavy website(a blog website)
I used CSS( cascading style sheets) and HTML5 to achieve my desired goal which is to have a transparent side bar which could operate in dark/light modes of a website.
