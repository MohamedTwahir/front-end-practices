In this task i learnt about typography by building a nutrition label that is mainly found in groceries packages.
I used CSS and HTML for it.The idea for the project was in freeCodeCamp a series am doing about Responsive Web Design.
I am getting to learn new concepts everyday in that series.
I have included a picture of it too.
